<h1>Hello My name is Samuel Huanosto Jr.</h1>
<p>
  In this project I was able to create my own Personal Website! I accomplished this task using HTML, Javascript, CSS as well as importing functions from Bootstrap to successfully implement a Navbar. In my website you will find more information about myself, my skills and coding projects I have completed so far in this course. Not only will you see my completed projects but will be able to interact with them also! There is a link that will take you to a second window to play with these interactive projects :) Finally you will have the links to my Github Repositories, LinkedIn profile; as well as a short little video about my background, life and career goals.
