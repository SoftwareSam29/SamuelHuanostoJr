<h1>Hello My name is Samuel Huanosto Jr.</h1>
<p>
  In this project I was able to create my own Personal Webpage! I accomplished this task using HTML, Javascript, CSS as well as importing functions and styles from Bootstrap to successfully implement my personality. In my webpage you will find more information about myself, my skills and coding projects I have completed so far in this course. The best part is you will be able to interact with these projects, all you have to do is click on the project link! :) Finally you will have the links to my Github & Repositories, LinkedIn profile; as well as a short little video about my background, life and career goals.
